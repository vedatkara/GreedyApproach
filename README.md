# GreedyApproach
Solving a problem by using Greedy method in Java
Scenario of the Assignment:
Assume that you are the owner of a football club. Your club has enough trainers to improve and
promote ‘p’ players to the main squad from the youth team. Some other clubs ask to rent players
from your club and make several demands for renting players from your club. The number of
demands can be different from year to year. You should design a renting plan for the next ‘n’
years. Consider ‘i’ is the index of each year (i=1,…,n) and yi is the number of players will be
requested to rent for ith year. If your club needs to promote more than ‘p’ players for a year, you
can hire some coaches, paying ‘c’ TL costs per player for that year. However, if your club keeps
any unrented player in that year, you should pay a ‘salary’ for a such player.
An example to understand the problem:
Your current trainers can promote p=5 players in a year, for a four years’ plan (n=4), y[ ] = { 8, 4,
7, 4 } and Salary(1) = 5, Salary(2)= 7, Salary(3)=10, Salary(4)=12, Salary(5)=13, etc. and c=10 TL.
For the first year, your trainers can promote 5 players, however, the demand is 8. You can hire
coaches with the cost of c*(8-5)=10*3= 30 TL.
For the second year, the demand is 4, will you promote 5 players and keep 1 player in the squad
for the next years for not paying coach costs? Or will you just promote just 4 players?
Greedy approach that computes the minimum total costs to promote players for the planned n years.
Some variables are given in the ‘yearly_player_demand.txt’ and ‘players_salary.txt’ files.
The rest of variables (‘n’, ‘p’, ‘c’) will be assigned to constant values at the beginning of the code.
